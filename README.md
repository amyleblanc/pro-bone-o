## Welcome to our Final Group Project "Pro-Bone-O"!

Developed by [Amy McCarthy](https://github.com/amyleblanc), [Rhys Wood](https://github.com/rhyswood) and [Bryson Best](https://github.com/brysonbest).

This full stack app was created in 3 weeks for the final group project of the [Lighthouse Labs Web Development Flex Bootcamp program](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/en/web-development-flex-program) while we continued to work our regular full-time jobs.

Our app helps dog owners find free dog walking/sitting services in their area utilizing the Google Maps API. This app uses React and Recoil on the frontend, with PostgreSQL and Express for our database and backend server.

A limited version of the app was deployed on Netlify for demo purposes (see [here](https://pro-bone-o.netlify.app/)) but is not production ready.
